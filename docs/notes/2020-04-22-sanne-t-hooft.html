<p>Sanne ‘t Hooft is a teacher at the University of Applied Sciences (HvA). And he was invited to give us a lecture.</p>

<p>In which he showed us what you can create with CSS only. He also showed us a few <a href="https://www.sinds1971.nl/spelenmetcss/index.html">examples</a> created by his students, in fresman year. Which to be honest is pretty awesome to see, especially when they are just starting out.</p>

<p>The one that stood out to me the most was Spongebob, can you believe it? At first I thought the used vectors, but it turns out it’s only CSS. But to be honest they are all really awesome!</p>

<p>After this he explained a bit about micro interactions. He talked about the 4 components which would make micro interactions, based on Dan Saffers book ‘Microinteractions: Designing with Details’.</p>

<p>After the lecture I got more interested to design things so I could create it with CSS.</p>

<p>It definitely sparked my interest to create more things with CSS. And I hope to do so in the near future.</p>
