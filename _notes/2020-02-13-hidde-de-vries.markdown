Hidde de vries is an accessibility specialist and web developer in the WAI team and works at [W3C](https://www.w3.org/People/hidde/).

He talked a bit about what he does at W3C. He focusses on implementing new web technologies, things like grid. And that it takes quite some time in order for things to get full browser support.

## responsive
In order to create responsive website,you used to need some hacks in order to get website responsive. Can you imagine, what you had to do without flexbox or grid. Well I certainly can and it wasn't as bad as I remember, but boy does flexbox save a lot of headache.

I definitly could relate a lot when he was talking about what we used to do and how much better it got. And it's quite interesting how fast it changed.
